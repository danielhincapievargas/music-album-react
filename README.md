## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- React.js

### What I learned

I learned how to handle events and manage states in React.js.


```jsx
const [like, setlike] = useState(liked);

    const handleLike = () => {
        setlike(!like);
    };
```
```jsx
<div className={like ? "card__heart--liked" : "card__heart"}>
  <i onClick={handleLike} className="fa fa-heart"></i>
</div>
```

### Continued development

First step: Single Card

Second step: Render multiple cards.
